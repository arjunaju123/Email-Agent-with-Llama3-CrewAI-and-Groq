Dear Ringo,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your concerns with singing. I understand that it can be frustrating when you're having trouble with pitch accuracy. 

The good news is that with practice and exercises, most people can learn to sing. Innate abilities can be developed and improved with practice and patience. You might be surprised to know that certain exercises like pole dancing and yoga can even help strengthen your core muscles, which can improve your vocal power.

Additionally, gargling warm salt water can help relieve inflammation and keep your throat moist. It's also important to note that congenital amusia, a disorder that affects 1 in every 75 people, can prevent people from hearing differences in pitch, tone, and rhythm. However, with practice, most people can learn to sing, regardless of innate talent.

If you're interested in improving your singing, I would recommend exploring exercises and practices that can help you develop your skills. If you have any more specific questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Sarah the Resident Manager
