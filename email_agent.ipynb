    "Let's go through this picture bottom up so that we understand how they come together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool: A tool object is a utility/equipment that the agents use to perform a specific task efficiently. For example, searching the web, loading documents & reading them, etc. Crewai is built with LangChain, we can use any existing ones from LangChain or we can write our custom tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Task, as the name suggests, is the specific task that needs to be executed. An Agent performs a task. We provide various tools that are required to execute a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents: An agent is like a team member in the crew, with a specific role, background story, goal, and memory. The agent is the core performer of the tasks assigned within the framework. Each CrewAI Agent is a LangChain Agent, but enhanced with a ReActSingleInputOutputParser. This parser is specially modified to better support role-playing, incorporates a binding stop word for contextual focus, and integrates a memory mechanism, using ConversationSummaryMemory for maintaining the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crew: Think of the crew as a team of agents, working together to achieve a particular goal. These agents have a clearly defined way to collaborate to achieve the set of tasks at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: Process object is the workflow or strategy the crew follows to complete tasks. 3 strategies are defined by the framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential: This strategy executes the given “tasks” in sequence, and in a particular defined order. This strategy is ideal for any pipeline type of work, where each agent performs a specific task and passes it to the next agent. We will use this strategy in our example today to write a blog, for a given topic.\n",
    "Hierarchical: This strategy organizes tasks in a hierarchy, and these tasks are delegated in a hierarchical fashion and executed based on chain of command. This is remarkably close to an orchestrator kind of pattern. This is like a manager assigning work to various agents, and validating the results, before completing the work. When we use this strategy, we need to configure a manager_llm, that helps take the right decision. We will be building a solution using this strategy in the next blog.\n",
    "Consensual Process (Planned): This is one of the most popular strategies, which is yet to be released, where we have agents talking to each other to get the work done. This is based on collaborative decision-making and the decisions are taken democratically. This is not yet released, but we have other multi-system frameworks, and have already implemented this strategy. We will explore this in future blogs"

      "The element that causes some people to sing well and others to sing badly are problems with pitch accuracy, also known as intonation. Pitch can be understood as the 'sharpness' of a voice; the higher the pitch, the sharper and shriller the voice sounds. Some people are born with certain innate abilities that melt our hearts or astonish us. The above reasons for thinking that you can't sing can be changed to knowing you can sing. The first step is to realize that you were born with every tool needed to produce a beautiful singing voice. All you have to do is to learn how to use these tools. You deserve a decent singing voice. Solution. I know this might sound a bit unconventional, but if you want to strengthen your core, pole dancing and Yoga are actually great exercises. Many singers have started doing them and have seen a huge improvement in their vocal power. Another important thing for singing is having strong lungs. Gargle salt water. Gargling warm salt water may help treat laryngitis by keeping your throat moist and relieving inflammation. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to a glass of warm water and try gargling two ... About 1.5% of the world's population - or 1 in every 75 people - is affected by a disorder called congenital amusia, which prevents them from hearing a difference in pitch, tone, and rhythm. Virtually anyone else can learn to sing with practice, so don't listen to the nonsense that you don't have the innate talent to sing.\n",
